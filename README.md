# 👋 Hi, I’m Elise Pitre

I’m a **Software Engineering student at the University of Guelph** (B.Comp. Honours Co-op, Minor in Sustainable Business) with a strong interest in building clean, maintainable systems and exploring the human side of computing — especially how **cognitive biases shape technology**.

Currently, I’m a **CI/CD Pipeline Developer Intern at SAP Canada**, where I work on **optimizing Jenkins-based pipelines supporting ~50 developers**, refactoring with **unittest** and **OOP principles**, and improving reliability across teams using **Bash, Python, and Groovy**.

Beyond automation, I love **problem-solving and creating thoughtful user experiences** — whether through backend logic, UI design, or systems integration.
