# 👋 Hi, I’m Elise Pitre


I’m a **Software Engineering student at the University of Guelph** (B.Comp. Honours Co-op, Minor in Sustainable Business) with a strong curiosity to learn and explore all sides of software development. I’m still early in my career journey and am **actively seeking new experiences** to build my skills, expand my knowledge, and discover new interests along the way.

Currently, I’m a **CI/CD Pipeline Developer Intern at SAP Canada**, where I help improve **Jenkins-based pipelines supporting ~50 developers**, refactoring with **unittest** and **OOP principles**, and enhancing reliability across teams using **Bash, Python, and Groovy**.

Beyond coding, I enjoy exploring the human side of computing — especially how **cognitive biases shape technology**.
